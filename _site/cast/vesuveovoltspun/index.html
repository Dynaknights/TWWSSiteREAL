  <p><strong>Vesuveo Vesper Voltspun</strong>'s a man of pragmatism, facts, and science. Both brains <em>and</em> plenty of brawn.</p>
<p>Thus, after years of diligent research, observations, hypotheses, revisions, injuries, and an embarrassing number of hours spent moping on dimly-lit rooftops all by his lonesome, Vesuveo's reached a logical conclusion regarding a question that's been bugging him: <strong>is his life worth living</strong>?</p>
<p>He sounds philosophical (or edgy, he supposes) here, which… <em>fair</em>, it's a loaded question. Although, Vesuveo's never been much of the philosophical sort, so he just… dissected anything to do with himself to see if he liked what he saw and predicted.<br>
Don't judge him. How else is a guy gonna go about this? <em>Therapy</em>?</p>
<p>Anyway, so, according to the data, the answer's a solid <strong>no</strong> all across the board.<br>
It's not even close, man. It's like, by a fucking landslide. It's so <strong>bad</strong>, it's <strong>funny</strong> he lacks the stars-damned pretentious verbosity to describe it.</p>
<p>Now that Vesuveo's experiencing the world from the fresh eyes of an adult, as opposed to a child with too much time for research as opposed to socializing (read: loneliness and neglect), he's realizing that he's kind of… <em>not a person</em>.<br>
Just to clarify — he doesn't mean, like, <em>inferior</em>. Well, uhm, his mental state's cemented that idea since he was a kid, but he means this <strong>literally</strong>.</p>
<p>It's <strong>strange</strong>, in his opinion. <strong>Fascinating</strong>, sure, but strange.</p>
<p>Like, Vesuveo's a <strong>vigilante</strong>, for fuck's sake. One of the most well-known in the so-called '<strong>Super Capital of the World</strong>,' actually. He's lived such an eventful life, y'know; he went from a reclusive, nerdy tween to a super on a quest to bring about meaningful and beneficial change to the world practically overnight.<br>
However, everything's just <strong>wrong</strong>, somehow. Like, Vesuveo's self and experiences aren't his — and everything he claims to be his is merely him wishing he was at least <em>mildly</em> normal to make up for having a childhood that was spent living <strong>vicariously</strong>; observing, learning, but never <strong>doing</strong>. Being forced to be an adult too early and desperately clawing at straws to get the full human experience before Vesuveo hits the grave.<br>
Is that like, weird, actually? He genuinely doesn't know, because he's never sure how to go about asking while being both coherent and concise.</p>
<p>Vesuveo feels like some <strong>pathetic excuse</strong> of a person; a chronic case of <strong>temporal consciousness</strong> rendering life as nothing more than completing one exhausting, useless task after another, with nothing ever fucking changing, despite what actions he makes. Does change breed sameness or something?<br>
He <em>assures</em> you he tries his absolute best, along with everything he does!
He strives to <strong>change</strong> himself and <strong>evolve</strong> as a person, leaving his comfort zone, even learning to trust others, the whole shebang — but the road ahead looks just as <em><strong>stars-dammed barren and hopeless</strong></em> as it did years ago!</p>
<p>Fucking hell, dude. In the super-powered sphere, Vesuveo's alter-ego — <strong>Web-Surfer</strong> — is nothing short of an <strong>inspiration</strong> to many, despite his anonymity and reclusiveness.</p>
<p>However, looking back on the hard data…</p>
<p>He doesn't know what to do.</p>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adehesion-based wall-crawling</strong><br>
<a href="http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=111">Setules</a> (bristles) on Vesuveo's hands and feet enable him to 'stick' onto solid surfaces. These are very, <em>VERY</em> <a href="https://thescienceof.org/wall-crawling-spider-man-geckos-van-der-waals-forces/">sticky</a> to make up for Vesuveo not being spider-sized. His palms and soles look unnaturally hairy.</li>
<li><strong>Organic webbing</strong><br>
Ultra durable, strong, and plentiful webbing is produced in Vesuveo's body, which emerges through the spinnerets in his wrists. Very limited and often bleeds due to overuse.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced senses, durability, speed, stamina, agility, and equilibrium</strong></li>
<li><strong>Somewhat faster processing speed</strong></li>
<li><strong>&quot;Spider-Sense&quot;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Highly accelerated metabolism</strong></li>
<li><strong>Healing factor</strong><br>
Not as good as <a href="/cast/wadewilson">Deadpool</a>'s or Wolverine's, but nothing to sneeze at either. Grants a resistence to alcohol and drugs, but not total immunity.</li>
<li><strong>Spider-like behavior</strong><br>
Has natural spidery instincts, leans into them more when mental health is in the shitter and/or social acceptance isn't a big priority.<br>
Most prominent of these include: reclusiveness, aggression, defensiveness, skittishness, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_(spider)">ballooning</a>, and — sometimes — feeling like he'll be cannibalized by romantic 'mates.'</li>
<li><strong>Chelicerae</strong></li>
<li><strong>Small fangs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Venom</strong><br>
Not the symbiote.<br>
Vesuveo's chelicerae can administer medically significant — but not serious, goes away on its own — venom. Symptoms include: muscle spasms, cramping, paralysis, numbness, tremors, and feelings of impending doom.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Return to Sender&quot;</strong><br>
You ever play <em>ULTRAKILL</em>?<br>
Vesuveo is able to counter any projectile with at least double of its oncoming force to send it back whence it came.<br>
Two problems with this: he needs to actually be able to hit the projectile (he cannot lightly tap it and said projectile must have a surface) and he must react fast enough to deflect it (punching bullets is a rarity).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrist-mounted web-shooters + web-fluid</strong><br>
This world is an advanced one that is so, so eager to invade your privacy. Technology developed to track people through a wide variety of biological signatures are not uncommon. Thus, Vesuveo developed a synthetic  variant. Also because the feeling of webs coming out of your arms is disgusting.</li>
<li><strong>Drones</strong><br>
Primarily for pictures and not exactly useful for most of his vigilante work. Used to photograph, spy on or track adversaries, and survey areas.<br>
Shaped like metallic bugs with massive lenses for faces.</li>
<li><strong>Web-wings</strong><br>
Remember ballooning? Yeah... This is how he does that.</li>
<li><strong>Computerized mask</strong><br>
Vesuveo's got a computer in his mask, Tony Stark style, but make it broke. No AI though.</li>
<li><strong>Hand and foot pads</strong><br>
Not just for decorating. His suit has dubious access to police resources and these pads can replicate fingerprints, provide small bursts of electricity, and... squeak when pressed on occasion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vesuveo has a lot of hair. Luckily, Web-Surfer's mask has <strong>hammerspace</strong>.</li>
<li>Scars can be drawn however. They should just look roughly the same in roughly the same spots.</li>
<li>Vesuveo is <strong>transmasc</strong>. He doesn't start officially transitioning (HRT, top surgery, phalloplasty) and appearing more masculine until adulthood.</li>
<li>On that note, Vesuveo also has <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome">PCOS</a></strong>; this makes him still fairly masculine-looking for an AFAB as a kid, not to mention his distaste for wearing feminine things of any sort.</li>
<li>Suffers from resting bitch face like none before him. Has a <strong>flat-looking deadpan</strong> or some other <strong>stoic expression</strong>, even if he's happy. You can also draw a shadow over his face, too.</li>
<li>His voice is also <strong>deep</strong> and <strong>slightly monotone</strong>. He's working on trying to improve this, and sounds remarkably less robotic than when he was little, but not quite perfect at sounding personable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vesuveo's favorite food is <strong>Chicago-style meat-lover's pizza</strong>. Does <em>not</em> enjoy chunky tomato sauce though.</li>
<li>Vesuveo was bitten by a frantic, abnormally large <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscodra_maculata">Heteroscodra maculata</a></strong>.</li>
<li>Vesuveo owns two female dotted humming frogs named <strong>Miette</strong> and <strong>Pippins</strong> because of a &quot;strange compulsion&quot; to own them so he can feel safer.</li>
<li>Has no clue of how his mutation works. He was bitten by H. maculata, but his abilities seem arbitrary and have nothing to do with spiders at all. Like, he initially believed his strength and speed to be proportional to that of a spider, but it's <em>more</em> than that. Forever confused by this.</li>
<li>Greatly enjoys cocooning himself in blankets, webs, and hammocks.</li>
<li>Very flexible! Vesuveo enjoys freaking people out by bending into weird positions.</li>
<li><em>Terrified</em> of wasps. Hates them to death.</li>
<li>Strongly against killing spiders and has never been bitten by one since that H. maculata. Has a few spiders in his apartment to ward off bugs.</li>
<li>Uses video game moves in fights. Did this when he was starting off due to a lack of combat training, but got too used to it even after learning to fight.</li>
<li>May or may not be the only person in the Voltspun bloodline to not be named after a consumable item.</li>
<li>Named himself after Mount Vesuvius because he was interested in death and natural disasters — especially volcanoes — when he was a kid to an unhinged degree.</li>
<li>He had tried 'Virgil' as a 'normal' name once, but it sounded too nerdy, like the name 'Lester.' He also hated being called 'Neuro-Die-a-Virgin.'</li>
<li>Really doesn't know how his Auntie and Uncle failed to get him checked and regulated as a kid, considering he'd never talk to anyone and only preoccupied himself with &quot;research.&quot; Hell, he rarely played video games until adulthood because he wanted to &quot;research&quot; them, not play them. Harbors more memories learning about video games as a whole (history, technicalities, development, sales, etc.) than really playing anything.</li>
<li>Despite all of his research, Vesuveo is still fucking stupid. His findings back this conclusion.</li>
<li><em>Despises</em> being psychoanalyzed, even for jokes by trusted friends. Immediately assumes they think he's 'slow' or stupid and is picking apart all of his flaws.</li>
