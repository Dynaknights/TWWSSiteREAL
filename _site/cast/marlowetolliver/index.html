  <p>Despite Mr. Tolliver's efforts, <strong>Marlowe Lore Tolliver</strong> is more than her father's child, and always will be.</p>
<p><em>Stars</em>, thank shit for that, 'cause, like, that old fart is so fucking <strong>BORING</strong>! Holy shit! Mr. Tolliver is — without a doubt — the blandest person Marlowe's had the displeasure of meeting, and the fucker's the most absent dad <em>ever</em>!<br>
Fucking hell! Tolliver's the <strong>number one arms dealer in the world</strong>, but he could at least spoil his only child if he's not gonna talk to her! At least momma's got the excuse of being <strong>dead</strong>!<br>
Y'know, she believed Mr. Tolliver was a <strong>boogeyman</strong> made up by her nannies and knick-knacks in the attic to keep her in line right up until the pair's first and last meeting, which ended with the son of a bitch getting a bullet between the eyes! People should be prostrating themselves trying to thank her for snuffing that fucker!</p>
<p>Ugh! Gross, gross, <em>gross</em>! Just thinking about Marlowe's childhood makes her want to puke.</p>
<p>Whatever, whatever, what-the-<em>fuck</em>-ever.</p>
<p>On a much lighter note, no one ever told her how much fun life was beyond the Tolliver estate!<br>
A <em>very</em> sizable inheretance, no tethers to the <em>ye olde ways</em> of crime, no more standing around in stuffy clothes learning how to disappear without a trace. Little old Marlowe can finally live life the way she wants to, and no one's gonna be stupid enough to tell her otherwise! Y'know, unless they want to be turned into mince meat.</p>
<p>And, ah! She's lived in Nouvelle-Yorke for, like, all of her life, but she's only heard of supers in <strong>hushed tones</strong> between her nannies to prevent little Marlowe from asking questions or — Stars-forbid — getting any <strong>unsavory ideas</strong> in her bouncy little head.</p>
<p>Seeing them trade blows, making such a fucking <strong>spectacle</strong> out of their ideals and morals is such a sight to behold up-close! Everyone's constantly scrambling to prove they're correct, or get the most money, or just piss people off for their amusement… It makes her so excited to finally be a part of! <strong>All the world's a stage</strong>, but the super scene offers so many stories with so many characters to religiously study, Marlowe feels like she's gonna <strong>vomit</strong> from it all!!</p>
<p>Ahahaha… Fucking hell. She's gonna have <em>so</em> much fun.</p>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>High intelligence</strong><br>
Marlowe's smart, but can't bring itself to put any effort into what she's doing unless she enjoys what she's doing. She won't write an English assignment, even though she knows she'd get at least a near-perfect score, but she <em>will</em> write fan-fiction that is scarily addictive to read.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rocket boots</strong></li>
<li><strong>Modified armored vehicles</strong></li>
<li><strong>So, so, so many bombs...</strong></li>
<li><strong>Innumerable weapons and suits stored in undisclosed locations</strong><br>
...Mostly explosive weapons.</li>
<li><strong>'Gun-brella'</strong><br>
A tactical umbrella that fires explosive projectiles. Blackmailing engineers is a beautiful thing!</li>
<li><strong>Sharpened teeth</strong><br>
She finds biting people to be fun.</li>
<li><strong>Massive hammer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Drugs</strong><br>
People are best understood at their most vulnerable states. Luckily for no one but Marlowe, it's fascinated by chemistry for dubious purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Megaphone</strong><br>
She wants to be heard, dammit!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Marlowe is <strong>chubby</strong>, please don't make her skinny! It's made of mostly round shapes, like fucking Santa Claus!</li>
<li>Marlowe is <strong>bouncy</strong> and <strong>expressive</strong> in both body language and face! Every emotion is dramatized and sensationalized, like over-the-top acting in a TV show! (I don't watch TV shows or movies and don't know how acting works)</li>
<li>Sometimes sticks her tongue out. Sure, why not.</li>
<li>Marlowe typically wears frills or lace, but you can omit these for fluffy accessories (i.e., sleeves, hoods, etc.), if that's easier for the wrists.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>Marlowe's favorite food is <strong>gingerbread</strong>.<br>
It doesn't play with its food (Marlowe's a sophisticated lady, thank you very much!), but it does create elaborate stories and designs out of gingerbread before chowing down. There's never a happy ending for her gingerbread men.</li>
<li>Marlowe is <strong>transfem</strong>. She's had a vague idea for all of her childhood that she wanted nothing more than to be a pretty girl, but she only began transitioning (HRT, surgery, appearing more feminine) <em>after</em> dismantling Mr. Tolliver's operations.</li>
<li>Most of her nicknames originated from Marlowe being creatively destructive with her mercenary work, oftentimes turning her targets into bright red smears.</li>
<li>Holds heavy appreciation for weird, surreal art.</li>
<li>Has written fan-fiction of multiple supers before and will do it again.</li>
<li>Great friends with Screwball, but, surprisingly, she doesn't see the appeal of live-streaming.</li>
<li>In that same vein, Marlowe believes herself to be &quot;best friends&quot; with a wide variety of supers (and random civilians) all across the moral spectrum that are seemingly chosen at random, regardless if her love is reciprocated or not. Remembers and recognizes each one of these 'friends' with horrific accuracy, and will even go so far as to organize 'outings.'</li>
<li>Barks, bites, and growls at people regularly. Not exclusively an indicator of a negative emotion. It just does that out of enjoyment.</li>
</ul>
