  <p>This line of work is a <strong>needless</strong>, <strong>hopeless</strong> battle, you're sure.</p>
<p>A <strong>one-machine war against crime itself</strong>; a pointless mission destined to fail.<br>
Yet, <strong>Percival &quot;Pyrel&quot; Franklin Castle</strong> <small>(&quot;PIE-rul&quot;)</small> finds themself back at that damned sniper's scope with their guilty finger on the smooth groove of a trigger, a brick wall newly painted crimson with the brain matter of a irrelevant rapist, and a new tally on an ever-increasing list of names tucked away in one of SHIELD's dense manila folders.<br>
Scrub the blood off — and repeat.<br>
Pyrel can't even remember the reasoning as to why or how their violence warped from military duties to their fucking <strong>destiny</strong>. Maybe it doesn't even matter anymore.</p>
<p>Regardless — by the Stars — they'd never have it any other way.</p>
<p>Pyrel wants to tell you somethin'. <strong>Enlighten</strong> you, if you will.<br>
Fruitless as this shit may be, they haven't come across a more effective way of snuffing out crime 'sides refining the art of fine-tuned violence. They suppose it's an acquired taste.<br>
Those <strong>spandex and caped types</strong> always try yappin' otherwise, but Pyrel's the one sporting a <strong>near-perfect success rate</strong> on stopping criminals here. Bailouts, escapes, paroles, and — most damning of them all — <em>repeat offenders</em> are a foreign concept to Pyrel's arsenal, which is more than your typical &quot;super&quot; could say.</p>
<p>People refuse to acknowledge it, but this is <em>hell</em>.</p>
<p>History repeats itself to fuckin' ridiculous extremes. The world's everything humanity's ancestors dreamed it to be, but it's still facing the <em>same damn problems</em> with the <em>same damn solutions</em> that've been tried to death for literal millennia and scratchin' it's ass, wonderin' why it's not fuckin' working, while prancing and shouting from the rooftops 'bout how <em>we've come so far from the start of the third millennium</em>.</p>
<p>What a fuckin' waste of time.</p>
<p>Nothing ever changes. That much is a given. But, Stars, Pyrel's gonna try proving themself wrong.</p>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>United Republic Army infantry training</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mastery of hand-to-hand combat</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mastery of marksmanship</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mastery of swordsmanship</strong></li>
<li><strong>General weapons proficiency</strong></li>
<li><strong>Scarily quick at learning how to use new weapons</strong></li>
<li><strong>Persistence (stubbornness)</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Explosives</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rifles</strong></li>
<li><strong>Knives</strong></li>
<li><strong>Swords</strong></li>
<li><strong>Shotguns</strong></li>

<li><strong>Extensive blackmail</strong></li>

</ul>
<p>...And more!</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pyrel's <strong>big</strong>, <strong>broody</strong>, and <strong>tall</strong> (over 6'0&quot;).</li>
<li>Pyrel's very square. Literally, their shape language is mostly squares and rectangles to look imposing and such.</li>
<li>Stone-faced. Resting bitch face? Regardless, they <em>very</em> rarely exhibit any expression beyond that cold, stone face or rage. Even then, the latter's rare, too. They rarely exhibit body language, too...</li>
<li>Is the blue on their hair dye or highlights? Up to you!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pyrel's favorite food is <strong>revenge; served cold</strong>. Kidding. They love <strong>burgers</strong> with <strong>coffee</strong>.</li>
<li>They drink black coffee just fine, but they prefer a packet of sugar and two shots of creamer. Won't admit this to anyone. Ever. Including themself.</li>
<li>Has an... <em>indescribable</em> reaction to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal,_Ready-to-Eat">MREs</a></strong>.</li>
<li>Greatly dislikes the URL Army and police after they began associating the Punisher's logo for their own agendas. Very, <em>very</em> begrudgingly hit up She-Hulk to force them to stop (along with death threats, of course).</li>
<li>Harbors mixed feelings toward their dead ex-wife. Unsure of how to feel about her.</li>
<li>Very interested in weapons; mainly guns. For effective killing, of course, but also actually understanding the engineering behind such tools and how they work so well (or do not).</li>
<li>Very mild Warhammer: 40k fan. Finds comfort in its bleak setting.</li>
</ul>
