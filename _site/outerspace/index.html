  <p><strong>Our Galactic Glory</strong>, in its infinite love and darkness, is as <strong>fallible</strong> and <strong>susceptible</strong> to the <strong>mind</strong> as each and every one of us. It, too, is not <strong>untouchable</strong>, even though its <strong>Self</strong> is <strong>incomprehensibly different</strong> to our own — yet undeniably <strong>similar</strong>, as many mortals would argue.</p>
<p>The mess of other, distant universes beyond Our Glory's own eternity had it flown into a rage from each of their respective, glaring <strong>imperfections</strong>, resulting in it curling in on itself for the rest of foreseeable time. However, the specifics of such celestial relationships are, unfortunately, beyond mortal understanding… or are they?<br>
Regardless, with this newfound solution to its turmoil, a new enemy had clawed itself out of the empty abyssal expanse: <strong>loneliness</strong>.</p>
<p>This <strong>perfect solitude</strong> was beyond measurements of time; there is no descriptor to accurately capture such a state in its totality, but it had drove Our Beloved Glory to <small>(literally)</small> <strong>never-before-seen heights of despair</strong>, in which it created all known to exist as <strong>parts of its Self</strong> to 'live' through a simulacra of what we define as the <strong>human experience</strong>.</p>
<p>…Or so the tale goes, anyway.</p>
<p>Now, as the human race, we aim to create our own stories, too, mainly to tell at parties.</p>
<h2>Twin Suns</h2>
<p>The <strong>Twin Suns</strong> (sometimes referred to as <strong>Sol-Surya</strong>) is the name given to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star">binary star system</a> comprised of celestials <strong>Sol</strong> and <strong>Surya</strong>. Sol is the larger of the two.</p>
<h3>Sol</h3>
<p>The Sun; a G-type main-sequence star. You know what the Sun is, unless you're an incel or something. Sol's just not called the Sun here because... there's two of 'em.</p>
<h3>Surya</h3>
<p>A small pulsar-like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf">white dwarf</a> orbiting Sol with a mass of 0.9 M<sub>☉</sub>, a surface temperature of 20,500 K <small>(20,226.85° C &amp; 36,440.33° F)</small>, and a luminosity of .0185 L<sub>☉</sub>.<br>
Surya can be recognized from the blue light it emits as opposed to Sol's yellow beams. It currently hosts a Dyson swarm known as the <strong>Valse d'Argent</strong>.<br>
Surya kind of just... appeared one day in <strong>late 2112</strong>, with the entire solar system abruptly shifting to adjust to this new celestial body. For example, Earth got abruptly shoved .8 AU away from Sol to accommodate for the extra heat.</p>
<h2>Valse d'Argent</h2>
<p>The <strong>Valse d'Argent</strong> is a partial <a href="https://www.space.com/dyson-sphere.html">Dyson swarm</a> aimed to <strong>collect Sol-Surya's</strong> <small>(mainly Surya's)</small> <strong>waste heat</strong> ~3.25 AU from Sol (a little bit beyond Mars' orbit).<br>
The Valse only collects <strong>~2.1%</strong> of this residual heat, but this smidge of energy — coupled with backup nuclear power plants — grants more than enough energy to last for generations and then some.<br>
Ironically, its development <em>also</em> took generations and then some through the power of capitalistic exploitation (read: widespread slavery).</p>
<p>Valse d'Argent is <em>not</em> a massive solid metallic megastructure surrounding Surya. Instead, it's a massive semi-circular network of manmade computational satellites which absorb this residual heat (and beam everything to Soma-Lune, then, to Earth), automatically dodge space debris, self-replicate and initiate any needed repairs for themselves or units close by (through a 'hive mind' sort of system).<br>
These units are comprised of various metals (primarily <strong>aluminum</strong>, <strong>titanium</strong>, and <strong>silicon</strong>) scrounged from distant planets considered neighbors and far, far away alike. The Valse d'Argent was initially intended for Alpha Centauri's waste heat, with the project beginning in late 2112, but Surya was a conveniently placed surprise. The Valse was adjusted to target this new white dwarf.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the Valse d'Argent lacks actual silver. The name refers to its shiny silver sheen.</p>
<h2>Pas de Trois</h2>
<p>The <strong>Pas de Trois</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_system_(astronomy)">natural satellite system</a> consisting of three natural satellites (moons) orbiting Earth.<br>
Soma-Lune has been in existence since Earth's conception, but the other two satellites appeared without explanation at the same time as Surya - late 2112. All remain uninhabited by the layperson due to a lack of data and a lack of... appeal (read: fear of the unknown), but the bonus two satellites may or may not be promoted to 'tech management' satellites — like Soma-Lune — in the future.</p>
<h3>Soma-Lune</h3>
<p>The Moon! <strong>Soma-Lune</strong> appears to be a large white pearl in the night sky with splotches of rusty red and navy blue up-close. Footprints of long-dead astronauts and eccentric, universally hated billionaires litter its surface.<br>
Soma-Lune is home to spacey tech nerds who begrudgingly banded together to form some semblance of a community; people managing the Valse d'Argent, resource harvesting, space exploration/studying, and things of that caliber. There's not a lot of them, and the inhabitants are regularly switched out to prevent loneliness, but it's a place people call home.<br>
According to Soma-Lune's inhabitants, the Pas de Trois are not made of various types of cheeses.</p>
<h3>Vainglory</h3>
<p>A blasphemous natural satellite. <strong>Vainglory</strong> is a big orb dressed up in a myriad of red hues, like Mars, but more saturated. Has weird markings and carvings from times long gone etched onto its surface of what appear to be religious rites of differing traditions. Not a lot of data is clear at the moment regarding them.<br>
Named after some sort of dead god; something or other.</p>
<h3>Antiochus</h3>
<p>A grand marble, indeed! It's the smallest of the trio. <strong>Antiochus</strong> is painted with child-like strokes of pale, desaturated blue and pink hues - looks a little suffocated.<br>
It, too, harbors strange etchings across its surface, along with suspiciously manmade structures dotting it. However, no man's ever been there long enough to construct such elaborate works.<br>
The name's origins are a mystery, but it's something concerning nihilism, maybe.</p>
<h2>The Cosmology of Fuck-Ups</h2>
<h3>Bugs</h3>
<p>There's been some suspicion that the universe is <strong>dying</strong> in a way no one ever thought it would; <strong>eroding at the seams</strong> — having each and every aspect of reality <strong>collapsing in on itself</strong> one at a time until it, for lack of better words, <strong>breaks itself out of existence</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, albeit extremely rare, there have been reports of things or even entire people <strong>vanishing without a trace</strong>, even in front of others' eyes without so much as a <strong>warning</strong>. Sometimes, it even goes so far as to clear anything and everything even remotely relating to one's existence, leaving a <strong>hole</strong> where one once was, but can no longer be remembered. If one isn't completely missing or damned out of reality, perhaps they're lacking a limb or an organ in their place.<br>
Shockingly, the <strong>opposite</strong> can also happen. The dead can be temporarily <strong>revived</strong> as if nothing had happened, people abruptly grow an extra appendage, or even new and never-before-seen <strong>strangers</strong> pop into existence bearing <strong>false memories</strong> at best or <strong>complete amnesia</strong> at worst before making it their life's mission to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Mostly, when people refer to <strong>cosmic bugs</strong>, they mean there's an object that's somehow halfway into a solid structure and won't come out — or, more commonly, they're referring to <strong>mutations</strong>; abrupt changes to one's <strong>genetic structure</strong> granting <strong>superhuman abilities</strong> in more notable cases.</p>
<p>It's unsure when this phenomenon first began occurring, but it's picked up steam ever since the Solar System was '<strong>abruptly and forcibly readjusted</strong>' in the year 2112 to accomodate for new celestial bodies with zero warnings or explanations; two moons and a sun: <strong>Vainglory</strong>, <strong>Antiochus</strong>, and <strong>Surya</strong>.<br>
The theory surrounding cosmic bugs is the best explanation for the three's arrival, since they each defy the 'traditional' means of celestial birth. Hell, they didn't even have 'births,' considering they simply <strong>&quot;spawned&quot; into existence</strong>.</p>
<p>The universe, despite major religious backing painting it as <strong>beyond perfection</strong>, is <strong>fickle</strong> and <strong>decrepit</strong>, it seems. Perhaps this spells <strong>doom</strong> for us all, and perhaps doom is what humanity needs.</p>
<p>Praise be to the stars.</p>
<h3>Earth-256</h3>
<p>Considering the potential of <strong>cosmic bugs</strong>, it's not far-fetched to wonder if such <strong>anomalies</strong> are instead natural by factoring into not just the <strong>death</strong> of the universe, but also it's <strong>creation</strong>.</p>
<p>Some results of cosmic bugs have gifted humanity far, far more questions than was previously conceivable. Objects or people pop in and out of our reality and give others the distinct impression that these things are <strong>not our own</strong>, whatever that could entail. They're… <strong>unnatural</strong> in every definition and conception of the word that descriptors are unable to justify.<br>
The few that, miraculously, can converse with us speak of <strong>times</strong> and <strong>tales</strong> beyond the scope of humanity at the moment (and possibly the foreseeable future); <strong>fantasy-like</strong> structures, people, beasts, and ways of living so drastically different that they wrap around to eliciting <strong>nostalgia</strong> from perceived <strong>sameness</strong>.
People have cited these strangers as seeming as <strong>otherworldly</strong> just as much as they appear <strong>human</strong>, like they've originated from an <strong>alternate version</strong> of this Earth.</p>
<p>At times, a large number of individuals that have never communicated (i.e., the population equivalent to that of a small country) will have <strong>interconnected dreams</strong> detailing of a <em><strong>life before us</strong></em>, as it's commonly referred to as. Exact details differ between groups, but what they provide remain <strong>consistent</strong> nearly every time.<br>
To make matters worse, this would explain certain <strong>odd-looking objects</strong> that we harbor <strong>zero understanding</strong> of, which also show up out of nowhere. It's looking grim for humanity.</p>
<p>These bugs have created a belief that they — and us — are the result of <strong>previous iterations of the universe</strong> (or even a multiverse, among the daring few), drawing from classical religious tales detailing the universe with a lust for <strong>perfectionism</strong>.
If these speculations hold merit, then it should be considered whether this iteration is that <strong>fabled perfection</strong> the <strong>Galactic Glory</strong> has been seeking or yet another <strong>failure</strong> to be swept under the rug. Or has the Universe simply grown <strong>apathetic</strong> toward it all?</p>
<p>Perhaps we simply don't deserve to know.</p>
