  <p>Hello.</p>
<p>My name is <strong>Kirimu. Machine works fine, too.</strong> Nice to meet you. Know me by another name? Most likely, that one will work, too.</p>
<p>I'm an engineering major and (allegedly) a &quot;fucking dork ass nerd.&quot; I'm a recluse with back pain who's notably unremarkable.</p>
<p>I made this site to assist in keeping track of canon lore and art of my Spider-sona-turned-paracosm/project -- <em>The Wondrous Web-Surfer</em> -- in an organized-ish manner. It's... not looking too organized at the moment, but I'm just one guy here, man. This shit takes forever because life is a bitch and, by the Stars, so am I.</p>
<p>I watched <em>Across the Spider-Verse</em> when I was sixteen, liked the movie, then saw a bunch of people make Spider-sonas and talk about how they were all technically canon to the Marvel Multiverse. Since I would begrudgingly say I'm a Marvel fan if held at gunpoint, I thought: hey, why don't I make one, too?<br>
Then, I got too caught up in making lore for him and combining deranged interests, like I was a fucking mad scientist. It turns out I greatly enjoy working on things where I have a cohesive way of engaging with things I enjoy.</p>
<p>So, here we are. My little shithole of a universe.</p>
<p>Something, something, <small>mutter, mutter, mutter,</small> excelsior.</p>

<li><strong>Video Games!!</strong><br>
I really love video games. Hahaha.<br>
I'm more into <strong>'retro' games</strong> and <strong>older game hardware</strong> than anything particularly novel (outside of a few titles), but my sentiment still stands. I suck dick at every game I play, but I still enjoy playing them anyway.<br>
If you're curious, my favorite consoles are the PS1 and Sega Saturn, but I also greatly enjoy arcade games, too.  If you're still curious, my favorite video game is <em>Undertale</em>. No, I don't like <em>Deltarune</em> all that much, sorry.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emulation!!</strong><br>
I need a means to play my nerd games, yeah?<br>
Currently, I'm using <strong>DuckStation</strong>, <strong>MAME</strong>, <strong>PPSSPP</strong>, and <strong>PCSX2</strong>. Mostly Duckstation though. PS1 games have captivated me recently.<br>
I used to only use RetroArch... but, after three or four years, the shitty UI got to me. So, now I'm in the process of looking for a frontend -- and more emulators for different systems, so I can play more games -- to coalesce all of my ROMs.<br>
Do I <em>need</em> a frontend? ...No, but I'm a sucker for style.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Science</strong><br>
Science is cool. I'm interested in just about anything that isn't geology, but I'm more of a fan of the space sciences than anything else, specifically: <strong>cosmology</strong>, <strong>astronomy</strong>, <strong>astrobiology</strong>, <strong>prebiotic chemistry</strong>, and <strong>astrophysics</strong>.<br>
I also enjoy <strong>arachnology</strong>, <strong>entomology</strong>, <strong>chemistry</strong> (begrudgingly), and <strong>biology</strong> (also begrudgingly).<br>
In an typical academic setting, I find any field of science to be horrible, but -- alas -- I still like these regardless.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Art</strong><br>
I've been drawing less and less as I've gotten older for a wide variety of reasons, but I'm still an art kid at heart.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rap, Rock, Punk, Metal</strong><br>
In terms of music, I listen to... not everything, but a lot of things! These are my favorite four genres.<br>
I have neither a favorite song nor album, but I've been listening to <em><strong>NASTYWERKKKK!</strong></em> by Femtanyl and ISSBROKIE, <em><strong>THE NILE IN EGYPT</strong></em> by Walkiing Intrusive Thoughts, and... too many Mommy Long Legs songs lately, coupled with my friend indoctrinating me into liking Outkast. Hahaha.<br>
I routinely return to <em><strong>2112</strong></em> and <em><strong>Hemispheres</strong></em> by Rush (their only two good albums), <em><strong>Equinox</strong></em> by Sorcerer, and <em><strong>Untitled 03</strong></em> by Kendrick Lamar.<br>
<small>I also like <em><strong>Invader</strong></em> by Kyary Pamyu Pamyu.</small></li>

<li><strong>Vinesauce</strong><br>
I like watching Vinny and Joel play weird games sometimes. Talk about dedication.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>...Comics?</strong><br>
This is a weird one.<br>
I like comics, I really do... but I also really <em>don't</em>. I find them simultaneously interesting and lackluster. However, my brain discovered Marvel in my preteens and refused to let go. So, I guess I'm here now. <em>TWWS</em> is probably the zenith of this fuckass interest. It'd probably be more accurate to say I like comic book <em>characters</em> than the actual stories themselves.
I'm not a comic book movie/TV show guy beyond <em>Superman</em> (2025) or <em>My Adventures with Superman</em>, sorry, but I find movies and TV shows to be really, really tedious to sit through, especially MCU things.<br>
I'm currently working through the main <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em> comic run (until <em>One More Day</em>, I guess), and my favorite comic book characters are Deadpool, Spider-Man, and Superman.</li>
