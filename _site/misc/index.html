    <h1>Miscellaneous!</h1>

  <p><a href="/updates">Updates</a> to this site will be woefully infrequent due to schoolwork, capitalistic greed, employment, and other life jazz. I will try my best to be as active as I can, but don't be surprised if I suddenly go radio silent for like, six months.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that I don't actually like Disney. I like a handful of Marvel characters. Even then, that's due to neurodivergency than any sort of legitimate attachment and I find the ones I <em>do</em> like to be... half-baked. I REFUSE TO BE A DISNEY ADULT!!</p>
<h2>Boundaries</h2>
<p><strong>NO PORN, please god!!</strong> I'm not a person to immediately hound on people making NSFW art but I just don't want to look at horny war criminals.
<strong>I'm fine with gore and violence up to a certain extent.</strong></p>
<p>Headcanons and self-shipping are... questionable. Headcanons are 50/50. Self-shipping (and shipping in general) is like a 30/70. I hold no power to stop you, but most likely, unless I know you (and you're not scum), I don't want to hear about it.</p>
<p>My name is <strong>Kirimu</strong> (Machine also works). <strong>I use he/him and exclusively masculine terms</strong>. Gender is for panty-waists and pussies. It's a waste of my time and effort.
<strong>I'm not a content creator</strong>. I don't make content for people to consume. This is an archive for me to remember, plan, and organize things better.</p>
<h2>Crediting</h2>
<p>This site uses the <a href="https://44x50.neocities.org/sites/character-wiki-template/">OC Hub Template</a> by <a href="https://44x50.neocities.org/">44x50</a>. It's really neat!!</p>
<h3>Scolding</h3>
<p>All works (art, writing, code, etc.) are mine unless listed otherwise. Do not claim it as your own or skip out on crediting me, lest I shove your teeth up your urethra.<br>
If I fucked up crediting you or if you'd like your crediting updated, just email me at <strong>Dynaknightslol[at]gmail[dot]com</strong>... but you can email me for (almost) any reason.</p>
<p>Feel free to use my works for <strong>personal use only with credit</strong>. I don't know <em>why</em> you'd use them, but you can.
<strong>Anything and everything created by me is not for commercial usage</strong>. I don't care what you do with my spaghetti code.</p>
<p><em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em> was created by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee.<br>
I'm not affiliated with Marvel. I'm just a guy who discovered Deadpool and Spider-Man through copious amounts of gay AO3 Superfamily and Spideypool fan-fiction. Clint is probably in my vents.</p>
