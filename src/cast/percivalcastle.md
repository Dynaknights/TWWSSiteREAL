This line of work is a **needless**, **hopeless** battle, you're sure.

A **one-machine war against crime itself**; a pointless mission destined to fail.  
Yet, **Percival "Pyrel" Castle** <small>("PIE-rul")</small> finds themself back at that damned sniper's scope with their guilty finger on the smooth groove of a trigger, a brick wall newly painted crimson with the brain matter of a irrelevant rapist, and a new tally on an ever-increasing list of names tucked away in one of SHIELD's dense manila folders.  
Scrub the blood off — and repeat.  
Pyrel can't even remember the reasoning as to why or how their violence warped from military duties to their fucking **destiny**. Maybe it doesn't even matter anymore.

Regardless — by the Stars — they'd never have it any other way.

Pyrel wants to tell you somethin'. **Enlighten** you, if you will.    
Fruitless as this shit may be, they haven't come across a more effective way of snuffing out crime 'sides refining the art of fine-tuned violence. They suppose it's an acquired taste.  
Those **spandex and caped types** always try yappin' otherwise, but Pyrel's the one sporting a **near-perfect success rate** on stopping criminals here. Bailouts, escapes, paroles, and — most damning of them all — *repeat offenders* are a foreign concept to Pyrel's arsenal, which is more than your typical "super" could say.

People refuse to acknowledge it, but this is *hell*.  

History repeats itself to fuckin' ridiculous extremes. The world's everything humanity's ancestors dreamed it to be, but it's still facing the *same damn problems* with the *same damn solutions* that've been tried to death for literal millennia and scratchin' it's ass, wonderin' why it's not fuckin' working, while prancing and shouting from the rooftops 'bout how *we've come so far from the start of the third millennium*.  

What a fuckin' waste of time.

Nothing ever changes. That much is a given. But, Stars, Pyrel's gonna try proving themself wrong.

## Notes

- Pyrel's **big**, **broody**, and **tall** (over 6'0").
- Pyrel's very square. Literally, their shape language is mostly squares and rectangles to look imposing and such.
- Stone-faced. Resting bitch face? Regardless, they *very* rarely exhibit any expression beyond that cold, stone face or rage. Even then, the latter's rare, too. They rarely exhibit body language, too...
- Is the blue on their hair dye or highlights? Up to you!

## Trivia

- Pyrel's favorite food is **revenge; served cold**. Kidding. They love **burgers** with **coffee**.
- They drink black coffee just fine, but they prefer a packet of sugar and two shots of creamer. Won't admit this to anyone. Ever. Including themself.
- Has an... *indescribable* reaction to **[MREs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal,_Ready-to-Eat)**.
- Greatly dislikes the URL Army and police after they began associating the Punisher's logo for their own agendas. Very, *very* begrudgingly hit up She-Hulk to force them to stop (along with death threats, of course).
- Harbors mixed feelings toward their dead ex-wife. Unsure of how to feel about her.
- Very interested in weapons; mainly guns. For effective killing, of course, but also actually understanding the engineering behind such tools and how they work so well (or do not).
- Very mild Warhammer: 40k fan. Finds comfort in its bleak setting.
