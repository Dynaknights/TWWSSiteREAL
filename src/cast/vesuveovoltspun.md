Go on, call him what you'd like.

Miserable. Wretched. Hell, even a *downer*, if you will. It's not gonna change shit in the long run; that's if there'll even *be* a long run to look forward to in the first place.

'Course, when **Vesuveo Vesper Voltspun** first got mutated thanks to that freaky ass spider biting him in the middle of his literal suicide attempt a while back, he thought — *heh*, don't make fun of him — his newfound superhuman abilities were the **coolest thing** in the whole fucking world. Y'know, 'cause he was **twelve** and didn't know what he was getting into.

The fuck's is a cooler thing to a twelve-year-old than getting superpowers?

Becoming a **vigilante**, that's right. Don't blame him, man!  
An emotionally unstable, lonely, and weird ass kid gets a chance to prove to everyone that he's more than some insufferable failure for the very first time by punching the living shit out of other fellow mutated freaks and saving people — of *course* he's gonna embrace it without thinking twice, even if it's behind a **mask** and a stupid **persona** he made up on the fly!

The **point** is that, well… Vesuveo's **tired**. There *is* no point to any of this.  
The larger-than-life melodrama of the super scene rings more of the pedantic social structures of middle and high school than anything, really. All the while, the world caves in on itself a little more with each day and humanity demolishes its own future, ensuring it'll never see **hope** in the present — and **nothing will ever change**, not for the **better**, anyway.

What, you thought he was gonna say some shit about **himself** being the ray of hope humanity needs? *Hah* — that's funny as fuck, but no.

Rather, Vesuveo feels… paralyzed. Equally unchanged as the **crime-ridden hellhole** that's called **Nouvelle-Yorke**, but also **unrecognizable**.  
He's trapped in a loop of guilt and moral obligations to the city by protecting it the only way he knows how, but there's no way in hell his vigilantism's been doing shit beyond delaying the **inevitable**. Problem is that there's not really **time** or **energy** to carry out better solutions when you live through major historical events **every day**.

Hah. Hahahah. Vesuveo's got no clue what to do. There's no one to turn to. There's probably nothing he *can* do other than sit there and **watch**.

We're all fucked.

## Attributes

### Abilities
- **Adehesion-based wall-crawling**  
[Setules](http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=111) (bristles) on Vesuveo's hands and feet enable him to 'stick' onto solid surfaces. These are very, *VERY* [sticky](https://thescienceof.org/wall-crawling-spider-man-geckos-van-der-waals-forces/) to make up for Vesuveo not being spider-sized. His palms and soles look unnaturally hairy.
- **Organic webbing**  
Ultra durable, strong, and plentiful webbing is produced in Vesuveo's body, which emerges through the spinnerets in his wrists. Very limited and often bleeds due to overuse.
- **Enhanced senses, durability, speed, stamina, agility, and equilibrium**  
- **Somewhat faster processing speed**
- **"Spider-Sense"**
- **Highly accelerated metabolism**
- **Healing factor**  
Not as good as [Deadpool](/cast/wadewilson)'s or Wolverine's, but nothing to sneeze at either. Grants a resistence to alcohol and drugs, but not total immunity.
- **Spider-like behavior**  
Has natural spidery instincts, leans into them more when mental health is in the shitter and/or social acceptance isn't a big priority.  
Most prominent of these include: reclusiveness, aggression, defensiveness, skittishness, [ballooning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_(spider)), and — sometimes — feeling like he'll be cannibalized by romantic 'mates.'
- **Chelicerae**
- **Small fangs**
- **Venom**  
Not the symbiote.  
Vesuveo's chelicerae can administer medically significant — but not serious, goes away on its own — venom. Symptoms include: muscle spasms, cramping, paralysis, numbness, tremors, and feelings of impending doom.
- **"Return to Sender"**  
You ever play *ULTRAKILL*?  
Vesuveo is able to counter any projectile with at least double of its oncoming force to send it back whence it came.  
Two problems with this: he needs to actually be able to hit the projectile (he cannot lightly tap it and said projectile must have a surface) and he must react fast enough to deflect it (punching bullets is a rarity).

### Equipment
- **Wrist-mounted web-shooters + web-fluid**  
This world is an advanced one that is so, so eager to invade your privacy. Technology developed to track people through a wide variety of biological signatures are not uncommon. Thus, Vesuveo developed a synthetic  variant. Also because the feeling of webs coming out of your arms is disgusting.
- **Drones**  
Primarily for pictures and not exactly useful for most of his vigilante work. Used to photograph, spy on or track adversaries, and survey areas.  
Shaped like metallic bugs with massive lenses for faces.
- **Web-wings**  
Remember ballooning? Yeah... This is how he does that.
- **Computerized mask**  
Vesuveo's got a computer in his mask, Tony Stark style, but make it broke. No AI though.
- **Hand and foot pads**  
Not just for decorating. His suit has dubious access to police resources and these pads can replicate fingerprints, provide small bursts of electricity, and... squeak when pressed on occasion.

## Notes
- Vesuveo has a lot of hair. Luckily, Web-Surfer's mask has **hammerspace**.
- Scars can be drawn however. They should just look roughly the same in roughly the same spots.
- Vesuveo is **transmasc**. He doesn't start officially transitioning (HRT, top surgery, phalloplasty) and appearing more masculine until adulthood.
- On that note, Vesuveo also has **[PCOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome)**; this makes him still fairly masculine-looking for an AFAB as a kid, not to mention his distaste for wearing feminine things of any sort.
- Suffers from resting bitch face like none before him. Has a **flat-looking deadpan** or some other **stoic expression**, even if he's happy. You can also draw a shadow over his face, too.
- His voice is also **deep** and **slightly monotone**. He's working on trying to improve this, and sounds remarkably less robotic than when he was little, but not quite perfect at sounding personable.

## Trivia

- Vesuveo's favorite food is **Chicago-style meat-lover's pizza**. Does *not* enjoy chunky tomato sauce though.
- Vesuveo was bitten by a frantic, abnormally large **[Heteroscodra maculata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscodra_maculata)**.
- Vesuveo owns two female dotted humming frogs named **Miette** and **Pippins** because of a "strange compulsion" to own them so he can feel safer.
- Has no clue how his mutation works. He was bitten by *H. maculata*, but his abilities seem arbitrary and have nothing to do with spiders at all. For example, he initially believed his strength and speed to be proportional to that of a spider, but it's *more* than that. Forever confused by this.
- Greatly enjoys cocooning himself in blankets, webs, and hammocks.
- Very flexible! Vesuveo enjoys freaking people out by bending into weird positions.
- *Terrified* of wasps. Hates them to death.
- Strongly against killing spiders and has never been bitten by one since that *H. maculata*. Has a few spiders in his apartment to ward off bugs.
- Uses video game moves in fights. Did this when he was starting off due to a lack of combat training, but got too used to it even after learning to fight.
- May or may not be the only person in the Voltspun bloodline to not be named after a consumable item.
- Named himself after Mount Vesuvius because he was interested in death and natural disasters — especially volcanoes — when he was a kid to an unhinged degree.
- He had tried 'Virgil' as a 'normal' name once, but it sounded too nerdy, like the name 'Lester.' He also hated being called 'Neuro-Die-a-Virgin.'
- Really doesn't know how his Auntie Brie and Uncle Gingersnap failed to get him checked and regulated as a kid, considering he'd never talk to anyone and only preoccupied himself with "research." Hell, he rarely played video games or with toys because he wanted to "research" them, not play with them. Harbors more memories learning about video games/toys as a whole (history, technicalities, development, sales, etc.) than really playing.
- Despite all of his research, Vesuveo is still fucking stupid. His findings back this conclusion.
