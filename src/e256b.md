The 'present day' of Earth-256-B is the tail end of the third millennium; sometime in the late 2900s, bouncing through the 2980s and 2990s, before teetering on the year 3000.

The mighty Earthlings have developed significantly in the technological and scientific departments and have finally become a [type II civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale). Alas, the walking and talking stardust finally get a taste of the true power output of stars with [Dyson swarms](#Solarfuse)!  
Not to mention the public support for space exploration and colonization; the question of existence in its entirety has entered the limelight with the rise of the so-called **Astro-Nuclear Age**!

Governments worldwide are also *finally* listening to the people after literal eons and millennia of suffering brought upon them by unchecked greed, selfishness, and megalomania. Living conditions get better by the day, basic necessities -- including housing -- are inexpensive, along with the pursuit of higher education. A strange obsession with fortified trains and trams have swept through the world in its entirety, but at least the scenery from the efforts to reverse climate change and habitat loss have made them true wonders to behold!

The Twin Suns shine bright as they smile down from the rose-lavender skies; their rays are full of promise... but will they be kept or swept under the rug like the rest of them?

## Outer Space

### Twin Suns
The **Twin Suns** is the name given to a [binary star system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star) comprised of Sol and Surya. Sol is the larger of the two.

- **Sol**  
The Sun, a G-type main-sequence star. The real deal. It's just not called the Sun here because... there's two suns.

---
- **Surya**  
A small pulsar-like [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf) orbiting Sol with a mass of 0.9 M<sub>☉</sub>, a surface temperature of 20,500 K, and a luminosity of .0185 L<sub>☉</sub>. Surya can be recognized from the blue light it emits as opposed to Sol's yellow beams. It currently harbors a Dyson swarm known as the Solarfuse.

### Solarfuse
Text later....

### Billet-Doux
The **Billet-Doux** is a [natural satellite system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_system_(astronomy)) consisting of three natural satellites (moons) orbiting Earth.

- **Soma**  
The Moon! Appears to be a large white pearl in the night sky with splotches of rusty red and navy blue. Unfortunately, not made of cheese.

---
- **Endymion**  
A large, staring thing... The biggest of Billet-Doux; rendered in a strange mix of white and light blue. Rocky with stretches of frozen (contaminated) water on its surface. Uninhabitable.

---
- **Bienveillante**  
A grand marble, indeed! It's the smallest of the Billet-Doux; Bienviellante is painted with child-like strokes of green hues. Uninhabitable. Commonly associated with fairies.

## Animals  
*Main article: [Animals, Evolution, Mechanical Infusion](world/animals)*

There's certainly a lot of technology, isn't there? *Too much*, some would say.
Technology is more like an organism than a tool nowadays. Certainly makes sense, seeing how it found a way to bind itself to Earth's organisms, one by one.

## Humanity  
*Main article: [Mutations, Evolution, Inherent Revolution](world/mutations)*

Earth's lifeforms have certainly evolved over the course of the millennium, haven't they? But what about those mighty humans?

X-Gene this and X-Gene that... but what in sandy seashells is the X-Gene, what's the difference between a *mutant* and a *mutate*, and have humans even changed at all ever since the far future?

## Notable Technological Advancements
*Main article: [Technology From a Far Future](world/technology)*

From powered suits and weapons that look straight out of a child's depiction of sci-fi, to artificial planets and matryoshka brains! There's technology galore, but it's like all of the engineers and programmers were on crack!

## Supers  
*Main articles: [Supers](world/supers) and [Super Teams](world/superteams)*

This is a superhero universe... it has superheroes, supervillains, super-antiheroes, super-antivillains, not-so-superhumans, and super-what-have-you, to the point where the word 'super' gets nauseating.  
The former article contains nuances regarding the so-called *'super scene,'* while the other contains information on some organizations, like the Avengers. 

## The United Republic of Leathucaria
*Main article: [United Republic of Leathucaria](world/url)*

...It's America. I wanted to spite Marvel's patriotism by changing the name and making it only American through location, history, place names, and vague resemblance.
Is Steve Rogers named Captain Leathucaria? Good question! Nope. He's still Captain America.

### Ville-de-Nouvelle-Yorke
*Main article: [Ville-de-Nouvelle-Yorke](/world/vny)*

The place where everything happens and nothing changes. It's teeming with innovation and a wide variety of emotions (typically annoyance or anger), and is desperate for change! Yet, deep down, everyone knows the stasis of it all feels like a hug at this point.  
Simultaneously famous and infamous for its deranged inhabitants, being a melting pot of diverse cultures, being a hellish clusterfuck of a city, and having the largest population of supers in the world!
...It also has an obscenely high crime rate, typically resulting in injuries, property damage, traumatic memorites, and deaths. However, some people greatly enjoy watching supers have destructive, anime-like fights!
