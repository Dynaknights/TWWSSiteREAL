The 'present' of Earth-256-B is the tail end of the third millennium; bouncing through the **2990s**, then teetering on the year **3000**.

Between the early 21st century and the 30th, humanity has improved significantly in nearly every aspect of society on a global scale, mostly in **technological and scientific developments**; finally — after many grueling years — they've reached the point of being a [type II civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale), among other notable achievements. These accomplishments have ushered the little Earthlings out of the Information Age — through a myriad of other ages and revolutions — and into the **Astro-Nuclear Age**. Good for them!

The Astro-Nuclear Age — unlike the **Empty Eras** falling between the 21st and 30th centuries — are, surprisingly, *not* mostly comprised of years of generational slavery to tirelessly build megastructures without compensation.  
However, despite the death of fossil fuels and the steady rise of eco-friendly living, higher global education rates, (*very*) slowly lessening poverty, along with governments finally listening to their people (sort of, anyway) to ameliorate the human condition, it's been noted life has felt **worthless**, **exhausting**, and **empty** among most (read: non-rich) people from generations beyond the beginning of the Astro-Nuclear Age for reasons that may or may not be related. It feels like nothing will ever truly change from beyond that time.

Even after the Empty Eras' end, everything still feels a little **hopeless**; a little **meaningless**, like it's almost the end of the world and everything as we know it.

Maybe it is. Praise be to the Stars.

## Humanity  
*Main article: [Mutations, Evolution, Inherent Revolution](world/mutations)*

Humanity prides itself as being **resilient**.  However, resilience is as subjective as it is scientifically unproven.  
Although, they did manage to survive to the late 2900s, so — surely — that amounts to something! …But not without struggles and — most notably — questions.

Like, what's a **mutant**, and how is that different from a **mutate**? How the hell does that shit even work? Have humans even done anything *remotely* significant or changed since the twenty-first century?

## Supers  
*Main articles: [Supers](world/supers) and [Super Teams](world/superteams)*

Immediately following the birth of **mutants** was the rise of **supers**.

Who — or *what* — are 'supers' and how have they affected the world around them? What is this so-called 'super scene' and the strange power-scaling celebrity sphere hell these individuals have formed? Most importantly: can you trust them?

## The United Republic of Leathucaria
*Main article: [United Republic of Leathucaria](world/url)*

The **United Republic** is a country that is totally, most indubitably, 100% ***NOT*** the **United States** at all whatsoever, thank you very much. They are two entirely separate entities, with the latter **no longer existing**.

Unlike the States in its wretched, writhing *chaos*, the Republic is a proud and collected nation. It's much more **stable** than the hellhole of America could ever be, thanks to the hard work of its diligent people and the astute minds of its impeccable leaders, who are nothing but dedicated to striving toward the future in the name of **starlight and prosperity**!

### Ville-de-Nouvelle-Yorke
*Main article: [Ville-de-Nouvelle-Yorke](/world/vny)*

A city that never sleeps, yet always dreams.  
Like most dreams, everything *happens*, but nothing ever *changes* <small>(for the better, anyway; everything somehow worsens with each passing day)</small>.

**La Pomme Grosse** — like the rest of human society — is ferociously gripped by the intensity of its own **spectacle**. Despite the strange history that haunts both Nouvelle-Yorke and the United Republic, both **everything** and **nothing** feels notably different when comparing 2990s Nouvelle-Yorke to 1990s New York; seems like all of its bumbling inhabitants are stuck in a **temporal limbo** of their own making waiting, waiting, and waiting for something to happen.

Also, Nouvelle-Yorke simultaneously has the highest amount of **supers** in the world, but also has the one of the highest **crime rates**. Does anyone even care anymore?
