Hello.

My name is **Kirimu. Machine works fine, too.** Nice to meet you. Know me by another name? Most likely, that one will work, too.

I'm a first-year electrical engineering major and (allegedly) a nerd, apparently. Fitting to the average nerd stereotype, it wouldn't be inaccurate -- albeit insulting -- to describe me as the socially inept sort, which I'm trying my damndest to ameliorate, trust. I've got the power of *Superman* (2025) in me.

I made this site to assist in keeping track of canon lore and art of my Spider-sona-turned-paracosm project -- *The Wondrous Web-Surfer* -- in an organized-ish manner. It's... not looking too organized at the moment, but I'm just one guy here, man.  
If you're wondering about the weird themes and '*creative liberties*' chosen here -- which is fair enough, since this is a clusterfuck and a half -- you should know that I have frequently turned to *TWWS* to aid in processing events, answering random existential questions, and giving myself a reason to pay attention in class, among others.

I watched *Across the Spider-Verse* when I was sixteen, liked the movie, then saw a bunch of people make Spider-sonas and talk about how they were all technically canon to the Marvel Multiverse. Since I would begrudgingly say I'm a Marvel fan, I thought: hey, why don't I make one, too?  
I proceeded to then get too caught up in making lore for him and combining deranged interests to the point where RFK Jr. would start making up health terms just to get me out of the public eye.

So, here we are. My little shithole of a universe.

Have fun.

- **Video Games!!**  
I really love video games. Hahaha.  
I'm more into **'retro' games** and **older game hardware** than anything particularly novel (outside of a few titles), but my sentiment still stands. I suck dick at every game I play, but I still enjoy playing them anyway.  
If you're curious, my favorite consoles are the PS1 and Sega Saturn, but I also greatly enjoy arcade games, too.  If you're still curious, my favorite video game is *Undertale*. No, I don't like *Deltarune* all that much, sorry.

- **Emulation!!**  
I need a means to play my nerd games, yeah?  
Currently, I'm using **DuckStation**, **MAME**, **PPSSPP**, and **Citra**.  
I used to only use RetroArch... but, after three or four years, the shitty UI got to me. So, now I'm in the process of looking for a frontend -- and more emulators for different systems, so I can play more games -- to coalesce all of my ROMs.  
Do I *need* a frontend? ...No, but I'm a sucker for style.

---
- **Science**  
Science is cool. I'm interested in just about anything that isn't geology, but I'm more of a fan of the space sciences than anything else, specifically: **cosmology**, **astronomy**, **astrobiology**, **prebiotic chemistry**, and **astrophysics**.  
I also enjoy **arachnology**, **entomology**, **chemistry** (begrudgingly), and **biology** (also begrudgingly).  
In an typical academic setting, I find any field of science to be horrible, but -- alas -- I still like these regardless.

---
- **Art**  
I've been drawing less and less as I've gotten older for a wide variety of reasons, but I'm still an art kid at heart.

---
- **Rap, Rock, Punk, Metal**  
In terms of music, I listen to... not everything, but a lot of things! These are my favorite four genres.  
I have neither a favorite song nor album, but I've been listening to ***NASTYWERKKKK!*** by Femtanyl and ISSBROKIE, ***THE NILE IN EGYPT*** by Walkiing Intrusive Thoughts, and... too many Mommy Long Legs songs lately, coupled with my friend indoctrinating me into liking Outkast. Hahaha.  
I routinely return to ***2112*** and ***Hemispheres*** by Rush (their only two good albums), ***Equinox*** by Sorcerer, and ***Untitled 03*** by Kendrick Lamar.  
<small>I also like ***Invader*** by Kyary Pamyu Pamyu.</small>

- **Vinesauce**
I like watching Vinny and Joel play weird games sometimes. Talk about dedication.

---
- **...Comics?**  
This is a weird one.  
I like comics, I really do... but I also really *don't*. I find them simultaneously interesting and lackluster. However, my brain discovered Marvel in my preteens and refused to let go. So, I guess I'm here now. *TWWS* is probably the zenith of this fuckass interest.  
I'm not a comic book movie/TV show guy beyond *Superman* (2025) or *My Adventures with Superman*, sorry, but I find movies and TV shows to be really, really tedious to sit through, especially MCU things.  
I'm currently working through the main *The Amazing Spider-Man* comic run (until *One More Day*, I guess), and my favorite comic book characters are Deadpool, Spider-Man, and Superman.

## Trivia

- I near-exclusively wrote Marvel fan-fiction (with names switched around and anonymized) for my high school's creative writing class. I got a 100% as a final grade.
- It doesn't look like it, but I've been coding websites for three years... never finished one though.
- Marvel's best Spider-Man and Deadpool writers are AO3 authors. No, I will not listen to opposing arguments at this time.
- I wrote about *TWWS* for my AP Lit final. I got a 100% on the final and an A in the class. How? I don't know.
- I'm also reading *X-Men: the Legacy Quest Trilogy* because I found a copy of the first volume in a Little Free Library. I'm hashtag winning.

## Contact
I truly hate to say this, but your best bet might be **Discord ((at)Dynaknights)** because I typically refrain from any social media usage at all nowadays. This site is the closest I'll get to any freely public social media profile, really.  
You can also shoot me an **email (Dynaknightslol(at)gmail(dot)com)**.
