Hello.

My name is **Kirimu**. **Machine** works fine, too. Nice to meet you. Know me by another name? Most likely, that one will work, too.

I'm an engineering major and (allegedly) a "fucking dork ass nerd." I'm a recluse with back pain who's notably unremarkable.

I made this site to assist in keeping track of **canon lore** and **art** (and whatever) of my Spider-sona-turned-paracosm/project -- *The Wondrous Web-Surfer* -- in an organized-ish manner. It's... not looking too organized at the moment, but I'm just one guy here, man. This shit takes forever because life is a bitch and, by the Stars, so am I.  

I watched *Across the Spider-Verse* when I was sixteen, liked the movie, then saw a bunch of people make Spider-sonas and talk about how they were all technically canon to the Marvel Multiverse. Since I would begrudgingly say I'm a Marvel fan if held at gunpoint, I thought: *hey, why don't I make one, too?*
Then, I got too caught up in making lore for him and combining deranged interests, like I was a fucking *mad scientist*. It turns out I greatly enjoy working on things where I have a cohesive way of engaging with things I enjoy.

So, here we are. My little shithole of a universe.

Something, something, <small>mutter, mutter, mutter,</small> **excelsior**.

- **Video Games!!**  
I really love video games. Hahaha.  
I'm more into **'retro' games** and **older game hardware** than anything particularly novel (outside of a few titles), but my sentiment still stands. I suck dick at every game I play, but I still enjoy playing them anyway.  
If you're curious, my favorite consoles are the PS1 and Sega Saturn, but I also greatly enjoy arcade games, too.  If you're still curious, my favorite video game is *Undertale*. No, I don't like *Deltarune* all that much, sorry.

- **Emulation!!**  
I need a means to play my nerd games, yeah?  
Currently, I'm using **DuckStation**, **MAME**, **PPSSPP**, and **PCSX2**. Mostly Duckstation though. PS1 games have captivated me recently.  
I used to only use RetroArch... but, after three or four years, the shitty UI got to me. So, now I'm in the process of looking for a frontend -- and more emulators for different systems, so I can play more games -- to coalesce all of my ROMs.  
Do I *need* a frontend? ...No, but I'm a sucker for style.

---
- **Science**  
Science is cool. I'm interested in just about anything that isn't geology, but I'm more of a fan of the space sciences than anything else, specifically: **cosmology**, **astronomy**, **astrobiology**, **prebiotic chemistry**, and **astrophysics**.  
I also enjoy **arachnology**, **entomology**, **chemistry** (begrudgingly), and **biology** (also begrudgingly).  
In an typical academic setting, I find any field of science to be horrible, but -- alas -- I still like these regardless.

---
- **Art**  
I've been drawing less and less as I've gotten older for a wide variety of reasons, but I'm still an art kid at heart.

---
- **Rap, Rock, Punk, Metal**  
In terms of music, I listen to... not everything, but a lot of things! These are my favorite four genres.  
I have neither a favorite song nor album, but I've been listening to ***Disorder*** by Joy Division, ***Skin O' My Teeth*** by Megadeth, and... too many random YouTube playlists, haha.  
I routinely return to ***2112*** and ***Hemispheres*** by Rush (their only two good albums), ***Deathconsciousness*** by Have a Nice Life, ***Equinox*** by Sorcerer, and ***Untitled 03*** by Kendrick Lamar.  
<small>I also like ***Invader*** by Kyary Pamyu Pamyu.</small>

- **Vinesauce**  
I like watching Vinny and Joel play weird games sometimes. Talk about dedication.

---
- **Comics**  
This is a weird one.  
When I first got into Marvel in my tweens, it was through *Into the Spider-Verse* and copious amounts of fan-fiction until I stumbled upon Spideypool. I near-exclusively consumed fan-fiction (and lengthy retrospectives) concerning Marvel for *years* because I disliked the convoluted mess that was the Marvel multiverse. It's still intimidating to this day, honestly!  
I liked *comic book characters*, but I couldn't bring myself to like comics... until now! ...In my adulthood. Maybe it's just because I'm less picky.  
As of **early 2026**, I'm working through: ***Spawn***, ***Silver Surfer***, and ***Invincible***.
