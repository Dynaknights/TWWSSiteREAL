## Where to Start...
**You don't need to harbor prior knowledge of the Marvel Multiverse to understand TWWS, but it's preferred.**  
However, fear not. There's an [Introduction](bleh) page that may or may not be worth reading, along with the details of [Earth-256-B](e256b) (and [the Universe](cosmos), if you wish). Beyond that, I dunno! Do what you wish. *Excelsior!*
