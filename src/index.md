The end of the third millennium heralds a colorfully bleak future.

Humanity's advancements in nearly every aspect of society over the centuries has mended a world riddled with problems; everything from **climate change** and **energy crises** to **famine** and **treatments for multitude of diseases**. Society will never be a perfect futuristic utopia, like their ancestors had hoped, but humanity can tip-toe around the edges between the land of living and the paradisiacal dead.

However, this conception of society is uprooted when one considers two (and a half) questions.  
Firstly, why does humanity feel so… **stagnant** in terms of ***everything*** over centuries, despite such exhaustive efforts to bring about **change**  
Despite being around for nearly 200,000 years, humans find themselves still haunted by the **same problems**: a notable lack of world peace, discrimination, poverty, and — most notably in this day and age — an **extreme surge of crime**. Even in spite of the number of superhumans that have popped up over the years claiming they wish to make the world a better place, it's… not better. Maybe a little **worse**, actually.  
Is this because of **destiny** aiming to preserve the integrity of the **soul**, or is it just **human nature**?

The second question's hangs onto the first. Why's the crime rate so fucking **high**? It's more than ridiculous, actually.

Bonus question related to the second: it feels like the guys supposed to stop said crime aren't doing **shit**. It's more like putting mini bandages on a gaping wound; failing to address the roots of the whole crime problem.

When [a guy](/cast/virgilvoltspun) gets bitten by a spider in the middle of his suicide attempt, he's forced to try grappling with the weight of answering these questions through the power of… **violence**. It seems to be working, so maybe he can pull this off.

## Where to Start...
**You don't need to harbor prior knowledge of the Marvel Multiverse to understand TWWS, but it's preferred.**  
However, fear not. There's an [Introduction](bleh) page that may or may not be worth reading, along with the details of [Earth-256-B](e256b) (and [the Universe](cosmos), if you wish). Beyond that, I dunno! Do what you wish. *Excelsior!*
