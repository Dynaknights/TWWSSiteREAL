To get something out of the way and off my chest: **this site had zero involvement with generative artificial intelligence at all whatsoever**. I don't condone the shit at all, and think it's fucking useless.  
 I took inspiration and feedback from others for some aspects regarding TWWS and how to go about implementing features on this site, but this is just a thing I thought was cool as a teenager and wanted to get out of my system, lest it be lost to poor memory.

If you think something was written by AI here, chances are it's due to my robotic/flat inflection and speech... and the copious amount of gay fan-fiction I inhaled as a nerdy child, which gradually improved my spelling and grammar.

## Boundaries
**NO PORN**, please god!! I'm not the type to immediately hound on people making NSFW art, but I just don't want to look at horny war criminals.
I'm fine with **gore** and **violence** up to a **certain extent.**

Headcanons and self-shipping are... questionable. Headcanons are 50/50. Self-shipping (and shipping in general) is like a 30/70. I hold no power to stop you, but most likely, unless I know you (and you're not scum), I don't want to hear about it.

### Scolding & Contact

All works (art, writing, code, etc.) are mine unless listed otherwise. Do not claim it as your own or skip out on crediting me, por favor.
If I fucked up crediting you or if you'd like your crediting updated, just email me at **Dynaknightslol[at]gmail[dot]com**... but you can email me for (almost) any reason. You can also shoot me a DM on -- \*gags\* -- Discord **((at)Dynaknights)**.

Feel free to use my works for **personal use only with credit**. I don't know *why* you'd use them, but you can.
**Anything and everything created by me is NOT for commercial usage**. I don't care what you do with my spaghetti code, because, y'know, this template's not mine.

*The Amazing Spider-Man* was created by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee.  
On that note, **I'm not affiliated with Marvel at all whatsoever**. I'm just a guy who discovered Deadpool and Spider-Man through copious amounts of gay AO3 Superfamily and Spideypool fan-fiction. Clint is probably in my vents.
