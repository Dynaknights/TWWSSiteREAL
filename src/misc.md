To get something out of the way and off my chest: **this site has zero involvement with generative artificial intelligence at all whatsoever**, thanks much.

## Boundaries
**NO PORN**, please god!! I'm not the type to immediately hound on people making NSFW art, but I just don't want to look at horny war criminals.
I'm fine with **gore** and **violence** up to a **certain extent.**

Headcanons and self-shipping are... questionable. Headcanons are 50/50. Self-shipping (and shipping in general) is like a 30/70. I hold no power to stop you, but most likely, unless I know you (and you're not scum), I don't want to hear about it.

## Credits

This site uses the [OC Hub Template](https://44x50.neocities.org/sites/character-wiki-template/) by [44x50](https://44x50.neocities.org/). Thank you! :D

### Scolding & Contact

All works (art, writing, code, etc.) are mine unless listed otherwise. Do not claim it as your own or skip out on crediting me, por favor.
If I fucked up crediting you or if you'd like your crediting updated, just email me at **Dynaknightslol[at]gmail[dot]com**... but you can email me for (almost) any reason. You can also shoot me a DM on -- \*gags\* -- Discord **((at)Dynaknights)**.

Feel free to use my works for **personal use only with credit**. I don't know *why* you'd use them, but you can.
**Anything and everything created by me is NOT for commercial usage**. I don't care what you do with my spaghetti code, because, y'know, this template's not mine.

*The Amazing Spider-Man* was created by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee.  
On that note, **I'm not affiliated with Marvel at all whatsoever**. I'm just a guy who discovered Deadpool and Spider-Man through copious amounts of gay AO3 Superfamily and Spideypool fan-fiction. Clint is probably in my vents.
