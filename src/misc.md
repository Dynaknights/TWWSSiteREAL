[Updates](/updates) to this site will be woefully infrequent due to schoolwork, capitalistic greed, employment, and other life jazz. I will try my best to be as active as I can, but don't be surprised if I suddenly go radio silent for like, six months.

Please keep in mind that I don't actually like Disney. I like a handful of Marvel characters. Even then, that's due to neurodivergency than any sort of legitimate attachment and I find the ones I *do* like to be... half-baked. I REFUSE TO BE A DISNEY ADULT!!

## Boundaries
**NO PORN, please god!!** I'm not a person to immediately hound on people making NSFW art but I just don't want to look at horny war criminals.
**I'm fine with gore and violence up to a certain extent.**

Headcanons and self-shipping are... questionable. Headcanons are 50/50. Self-shipping (and shipping in general) is like a 30/70. I hold no power to stop you, but most likely, unless I know you (and you're not scum), I don't want to hear about it.

My name is **Kirimu** (Machine also works). **I use he/him and exclusively masculine terms**. Gender is for panty-waists and pussies. It's a waste of my time and effort.
**I'm not a content creator**. I don't make content for people to consume. This is an archive for me to remember, plan, and organize things better.

## Crediting

This site uses the [OC Hub Template](https://44x50.neocities.org/sites/character-wiki-template/) by [44x50](https://44x50.neocities.org/). It's really neat!!

### Scolding

All works (art, writing, code, etc.) are mine unless listed otherwise. Do not claim it as your own or skip out on crediting me, lest I shove your teeth up your urethra.  
If I fucked up crediting you or if you'd like your crediting updated, just email me at **Dynaknightslol[at]gmail[dot]com**... but you can email me for (almost) any reason.

Feel free to use my works for **personal use only with credit**. I don't know *why* you'd use them, but you can.
**Anything and everything created by me is not for commercial usage**. I don't care what you do with my spaghetti code.

*The Amazing Spider-Man* was created by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee.  
I'm not affiliated with Marvel. I'm just a guy who discovered Deadpool and Spider-Man through copious amounts of gay AO3 Superfamily and Spideypool fan-fiction. Clint is probably in my vents.
