Blabbing and blabbing.

## Twin Suns
The **Twin Suns** (sometimes referred to as **Sol-Surya**) is the name given to a [binary star system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star) comprised of celestials **Sol** and **Surya**. Sol is the larger of the two.

- **Sol**  
The Sun; a G-type main-sequence star. You know what the Sun is, unless you're an incel or something. Sol's just not called the Sun here because... there's two of 'em.

---
- **Surya**  
A small pulsar-like [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf) orbiting Sol with a mass of 0.9 M<sub>☉</sub>, a surface temperature of 20,500 K <small>(20,226.85° C & 36,440.33° F)</small>, and a luminosity of .0185 L<sub>☉</sub>.  
Surya can be recognized from the blue light it emits as opposed to Sol's yellow beams. It currently hosts a Dyson swarm known as the **Valse d'Argent**.  
Surya kind of just... appeared one day in **late 2112**, with the entire solar system abruptly shifting to adjust to this new celestial body. For example, Earth got abruptly shoved .8 AU away from Sol to accommodate for the extra heat.

### Valse d'Argent
The **Valse d'Argent** is a partial [Dyson swarm](https://www.space.com/dyson-sphere.html) aimed to **collect Sol-Surya's** <small>(mainly Surya's)</small> **waste heat** ~3.25 AU from Sol (a little bit beyond Mars' orbit).  
The Valse only collects **~2.1%** of this residual heat, but this smidge of energy — coupled with backup nuclear power plants — grants more than enough energy to last for generations and then some.  
Ironically, its development *also* took generations and then some through the power of capitalistic exploitation (read: widespread slavery).

Valse d'Argent is *not* a massive solid metallic megastructure surrounding Surya. Instead, it's a massive semi-circular network of manmade computational satellites which absorb this residual heat (and beam everything to Soma-Lune, then, to Earth), automatically dodge space debris, self-replicate and initiate any needed repairs for themselves or units close by (through a 'hive mind' sort of system).  
These units are comprised of various metals (primarily **aluminum**, **titanium**, and **silicon**) scrounged from distant planets considered neighbors and far, far away alike. The Valse d'Argent was initially intended for Alpha Centauri's waste heat, with the project beginning in late 2112, but Surya was a conveniently placed surprise. The Valse was adjusted to target this new white dwarf.

Surprisingly, the Valse d'Argent lacks actual silver. The name refers to its shiny silver sheen.

### Pas de Trois
The **Pas de Trois** is a [natural satellite system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_system_(astronomy)) consisting of three natural satellites (moons) orbiting Earth.  
Soma-Lune has been in existence since Earth's conception, but the other two satellites appeared without explanation at the same time as Surya - late 2112. All remain uninhabited by the layperson due to a lack of data and a lack of... appeal (read: fear of the unknown), but the bonus two satellites may or may not be promoted to 'tech management' satellites — like Soma-Lune — in the future.

- **Soma-Lune**  
The Moon! **Soma-Lune** appears to be a large white pearl in the night sky with splotches of rusty red and navy blue up-close. Footprints of long-dead astronauts and eccentric, universally hated billionaires litter its surface.  
Soma-Lune is home to spacey tech nerds who begrudgingly banded together to form some semblance of a community; people managing the Valse d'Argent, resource harvesting, space exploration/studying, and things of that caliber. There's not a lot of them, and the inhabitants are regularly switched out to prevent loneliness, but it's a place people call home.  
According to Soma-Lune's inhabitants, the Pas de Trois are not made of various types of cheeses.

- **Vainglory**  
A blasphemous natural satellite. **Vainglory** is a big orb dressed up in a myriad of red hues, like Mars, but more saturated. Has weird markings and carvings from times long gone etched onto its surface of what appear to be religious rites of differing traditions. Not a lot of data is clear at the moment regarding them.  
Named after some sort of dead god; something or other.

---
- **Antiochus**  
A grand marble, indeed! It's the smallest of the trio. **Antiochus** is painted with child-like strokes of pale, desaturated blue and pink hues - looks a little suffocated.  
It, too, harbors strange etchings across its surface, along with suspiciously manmade structures dotting it. However, no man's ever been there long enough to construct such elaborate works.  
The name's origins are a mystery, but it's something concerning nihilism, maybe.
